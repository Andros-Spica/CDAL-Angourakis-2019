**Abstract**  

This is a brief introduction to the application of *agent-based modelling* (ABM) in archaeology. 

<!--First, it states the strong relationship between archaeology, other social sciences, and the development of the so-called *complexity science*. This framework have revolutionised social theory by bridging the gap between individual and society, agency and social structure. If understood as a social science, archaeology 


During the past half century, archaeology have been building strong bonds with other disciplines and can be considered today one of the strongests cases of of development of the so-called *complexity science*. ABM is deemed one of the best techniques to address complex systems, including the explicit representations of *distributed* and *multi-level* processes and temporal and spatial *variability*. ABM is both theoretically meaningful and compatible with the methodological constraints in archaeology. An agent-based model can be informed by a plethora of qualitative and quantitative data, as well as hypotheses, assumptions or other models. ABM is especially compatible with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Together with other computer simulation techniques, ABM sets up a framework to study the past *experimentally*, *i.e.* a '*virtual laboratory*'. 
The process of applying ABM is summarised in seven activities: **definition** of research question and phenomenon, **design**, **implementation**, **verification**, **validation**, **documentation**, and **understanding**. These activities are explained using an example of 
These points are illustrated by the mention of several works developed during the last twenty years (aprox. 2000-2019).
